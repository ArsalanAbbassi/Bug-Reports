Hi,
I am a web security researcher and i have found a XSS vulnerability in your website
Vulnerable area: https://www.ibisworld.com/

I found that the parameter "value" in search box coding lacks filtering, allowing the attacker to exploit this vulnerability to redirect users to a malicious site + The Attacker Can Exploit this bug to redirect the user to Malcious Site + The attacker can execute JavaScript code in the user browser
Because the user redirected by Javascript, The Attacker Can Exploit This Bug To Execute JavaScript By Use javascript: protocol

Steps To Reproduce:
1.Go to: https://www.ibisworld.com/
2.Search xx2 string numeric in search box and open inspect element by right click on mouse.
3.Find the xx2 in coding 
4.Change the value of parameter "value" by pay load "/><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>
5.You will see the XSS prompted

POC: https://prnt.sc/t8ifq7

Impact:
With the help of xss a hacker or attacker can perform social engineering on users by redirecting them from real website to fake one. hacker can steal their cookies and download a malware on their system, and there are many more attacking scenarios a skilled attacker can perform with xss.
