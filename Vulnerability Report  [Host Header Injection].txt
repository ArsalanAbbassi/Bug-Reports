Hi,
i am a web security researcher your website is vulnerable to Host Header Injection because the host header can be changed to something outside the target domainIn many cases, developers are trusting the HTTP Host header value and using it to generate links, import scripts and even generate password resets links with its value. This is a very bad idea, because the HTTP Host header can be controlled by an attacker. This can be exploited using web-cache poisoning and by abusing alternative channels like password reset emails.
