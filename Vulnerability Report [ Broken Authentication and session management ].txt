Hi,

I'm a web Security Researcher and found some security breach in your website which i am reporting to you

Vulnerable Site :  https://www2.hm.com/  
Steps to Reproduce:

[+] We Need to use two browsers

1- Login to one browser ( from Chrome )
2- Login to second browser same account ( From Mozilla Fire Fox )
3-Then change the password from Chrome browser.
4- After changing the password, go to Mozilla FireFox browser, the session will still be alive. The mozilla FireFox account should be logged out.
That means, server-side session not expire after password change.

Attack Scenario :
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A2-Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management

impact :

Attacker can re-use Old cookies to takeover the account

if user change the account password to make secure himself . Still he is insecure because his old session not expired and attacker can user old cookies to login.

old and new Both cookies are working at a time

How to Fix ?

Server-side session should expire after password is changed from one session, or it should ask (either logout from other devices/browsers)

Looking forward for your response
Thanks & Regards,
Asralan
