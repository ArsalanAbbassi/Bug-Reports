Hi Team,

I am a web security researcher and i have found a XSS vulnerability in your website
Vulnerable area: https://www.arkoselabs.com/

Steps to reproduce:
1.Go to the https://www.arkoselabs.com/
2.Find the search box 
3.Execute the malicious Jscode in search box e.g:
 "/><img src=x onerror=prompt(document.domain)>
4.The Xss prompt will be generated

POC: picture link---

Impact:
With the help of xss a hacker or attacker can perform social engineering on users by redirecting them from real website to fake one. hacker can steal their cookies and download a malware on their system, and there are many more attacking scenarios a skilled attacker can perform with xss.
needs to be fixed

Looking forward for your response

Thanks & Regards
Arsalan
