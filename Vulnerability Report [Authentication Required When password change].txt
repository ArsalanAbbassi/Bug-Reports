Hi team,
i am a web security researcher and i have found vulnerability in your website
Description of the issue :-
I have found that when changing password in my account there is no Authentication process by asking current password or any other confirmation

If a user leaves their computer or account is still active in insecure place,or if account is hijacked or if CSRF is exploitable[bypassed] we don't want someone else to be able to quickly change password.

I somewhat understand the existing password is required to prevent malicious users (who may access the current session on the user's machine) from changing password.

Impact
Since user can't recover his password , so if someone changes his password victim may not get his account back

Thanks & Regards,
Arsalan
